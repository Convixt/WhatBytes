# Skill Test Result Page

This project is a web application that displays the result of a skill test. It includes options to view, update, and analyze the skill test results. The project is built using **Next.js** for the framework and **Tailwind CSS** for styling. The application features graphical and progress bar representations of user performance using **ShadCN** components and an npm package for the progress bar.

## Features

- **Skill Test Result Display**: Shows the skill test results with a detailed analysis.
- **Update Modal**: A modal that allows users to update their skill test details. Once submitted, the new details update the results on the page.
- **Graphical Percentile Representation**: Utilizes **ShadCN UI Line Chart** to represent the percentile comparison visually.
- **Donut Chart for Score**: Uses **ShadCN UI Donut Chart** to show the total score visually.
- **Syllabus-Wise Analysis**: Includes an **npm progress bar** to show progress on syllabus topics.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive and optimized for different screen sizes.
